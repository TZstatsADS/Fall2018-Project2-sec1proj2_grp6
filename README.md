+ **APP Entry**:  [College Sense](http://)

+ **Project Summary**: 
College selection is always a big struggle to most of high school students. Based on this concern, our team designed a user-friendly ShinyAPP to help those with various information of US colleges from different angles. <br/>
We collected as much data as possible, and established four interactive and well-visualized funtioning pages: College infomation Map, College Comprison, Living Quality Summary and College Scoreboard.<br/>
We believe our APP will definitely provide graduating high school students with useful information to make optimal choices.
